      <h1>Official Rules — FastLanePrizes Sweepstakes</h1>

      <p><strong>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. A PURCHASE DOES NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.</strong></p>
      <p>This promotion is intended as a <strong>sweepstakes</strong>. It is void where prohibited.</p>

      <p>Mail-in entries must be postmarked before the promotion ends and received prior to the drawing. Each valid mail-in entry counts as one (1) entry and has equal odds of winning as an online entry.</p>
